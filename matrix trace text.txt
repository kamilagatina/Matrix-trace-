The input to the program is a natural number n -
- the number of rows and columns in the matrix, 
then the elements of the matrix (integers) line by line, 
separated by a space

n,track = int(input()),0
matrix = [input().split() for _ in range(n)] 
for i in range(n):
    track+=int(matrix[i][i])
print(track)
